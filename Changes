Major overhaul based on feedback from Perl community.

Factored coding standards into separate modules (known as Policies).
The idea here is to allow other developers to easily contribute
additional coding standards.

Reworked Perl::Review into a simple engine for loading and running
Policy modules.

Gave perlreview a command-line interface and configuration file
for selecting which Policy modules to use.
